Vocabulary Assessor (vocass) compares a list of words to a text document. Both the list of words and the text document are input in the form of .txt files. The program's output is a .doc file which contains a sequential list of all the words in the document that do not appear on the word list. Next to each word is the frequency that word appears in the document.
The user interface is easy to use. Just follow the instructions to upload a word list and a document and select a directory, then click "Run!". After clicking "Run!", the program will generate a file output.docx in the selected directory.
Note that the word list and the document both need to be txt files. The word list should not contain any extraneous lines but contains only the vocabulary.
